### Structure

  - [raw](./raw) contains the JSON files that were downloaded straight from the various spreadsheets, I consider the files raw as they have not been touched,
  - [data](./data) contains the JSON files after they have been sanitized and modified so working with them can be more friendly and easier, and
  - [combined](./combined) contains the sanitized JSON files combined via categories, which is determined by [this](../src/util/categories.ts) file.
